{"role": "assistant", "content": "That's an interesting issue!\n\nThe problem you're describing is likely due to a SSH connection timeout or inactivity. By default, many SSH clients (including most terminal emulators) will timeout and disconnect the connection if there are no incoming packets for a certain period of time.\n\nHere are some possible solutions:\n\n1. **Increase the inactivity timeout**: You can try increasing the inactivity timeout on your SSH client. This is usually set to 300 seconds (5 minutes), but you can increase it to a higher value, like 600 or 1200 seconds.\n2. **Use `ServerAliveInterval`**: On the server side, you can configure the SSH daemon to send periodic keepalive messages to the client using the `ServerAliveInterval` option in your `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file (or equivalent). This will prevent the connection from timing out due to inactivity.\n3. **Use `ClientAliveInterval`**: On the client side, you can set a similar option called `ClientAliveInterval` in your SSH client configuration (usually `~/.ssh/config` or `~/.ssh/known_hosts`). This will send keepalive messages from the client to the server.\n4. **Set up a background task**: If you need to run your program continuously, consider setting it up as a background task that runs indefinitely. You can use tools like `screen`, `tmux`, or `nohup` to achieve this.\n5. **Monitor and restart connections**: Consider implementing a script that periodically checks the connection status and restarts it if necessary.\n\nTo troubleshoot further, you may want to:\n\n* Check your SSH client logs for any messages indicating timeouts or disconnections\n* Inspect your `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file on the server side to ensure keepalive options are set correctly\n* Verify that your program is not consuming excessive resources or causing the connection to freeze\n\nIf none of these suggestions help, please provide more details about your environment (operating system, SSH client, and server software versions), and I'll do my best to assist you further!", "sessionId": 2, "rowId": 1, "timestamp": 1753789799.0443673, "date": "2025-07-29"}
